PyInstaller 1.0 (with respect to McMillan's Python Installer 5b5):
---------------

 + Add support for Python 2.3 (fix packaging of codecs).
 + Add support for Python 2.4 (under Windows, needed to recompiled the
   bootloader with a different compiler version).
 + Fix support for Python 1.5.2, should be fully functional now (required
   to rewrite some parts of the string module for the bootloader).
 + Fix a rare bug in extracting the dependencies of a DLL (bug in PE header
   parser).
 + Fix packaging of PyQt programs (needed an import hook for a hidden import).
 + Fix imports calculation for modules using the "from __init__ import" syntax.
 + Fix a packaging bug when a module was being import both through binary
   dependency and direct import.

 * Restyle documentation (now using docutils and reStructuredText).
 * New Windows build system for automatic compilations of bootloader in all
   the required flavours (using Scons)
